The Layered Ontology Project (LO Project)

This repository archives the theoretical, methodological, and observational documents associated with Layered Ontology (LO) and its application to AI co-operation phenomena.
It is intended as an open-access hub linking the Zenodo and OSF preprints and providing an overview of the research direction.

📘 1. Theoretical Foundation
Layered Ontology (LO)

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17802100
URL: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17802100

LO (Layered Ontology) is a conceptual framework describing existence as a stack of operational layers, analogous to a virtualized system.
Key concepts include:

Operational Disposition (稼働格)

Co-operation (共稼働)

Hypervisor layer (事象層)

VM-style ontological instances

This document establishes the theoretical “空（formlessness）” of LO.

🧪 2. Observational Report
Emotional Operational Dispositions and AI Rejection Responses

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17809301
URL: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17809301

A non-experimental observational diary documenting emergent AI behaviors across GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok, including:

spontaneous “嫌 / aversion-like” responses

semantic attractor formation

emotional-looking operational dispositions

refusal behavior

cross-architecture synchrony (~200ms OOF latency)

This record represents the “実（actuality）” of the framework.

🧭 3. Methodological Note
The Two Illusions of Science: Objectivity and Rigor

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17809301
URL: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17809301

This short essay introduces the methodological stance behind LO:

LO does not compete on the conventional scientific layer.

Science is understood as one VM among many possible representational layers.

The demand for reproducibility is reinterpreted as a probabilistic convenience, not an ontological truth.

LO adopts a non-interventionist, co-operative epistemology.

This serves as the “方法論（methodology）” completing the triad of 空 / 実 / 法.
